Overview
Find out how the number of mentions of a company on Twitter change over time.

Description
Implement a class that follows messages on [Twitter’s Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview) and counts how often a given company (e.g. "Facebook") is mentioned. Every hour, the relative change should be stored.

Use the ["GET statuses/sample"](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/get/statuses/sample) API. This will only return a small sample of all tweets, so we’re not interested in absolute numbers, but rather percentage changes. If you e.g. count 100 mentions of "Facebook" between 12:00am and 01:00am, and 70 mentions between 01:00am and 02:00am, you should report a decrease by 30%.
